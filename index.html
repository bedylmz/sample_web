		<p>The Melsonby Hoard is a hoard of hundreds of Iron Age items found buried in a field near the 
		village of Melsonby in North Yorkshire, England, by a metal-detectorist in December 2021. 
		The site was excavated in 2022 by archaeologists from Durham University with advice from the 
		British Museum and grant funding from Historic England. The find was publicised in March 2025, 
		coinciding with some of the objects being put on temporary display at the Yorkshire Museum in York.</p>
